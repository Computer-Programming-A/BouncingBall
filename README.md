Bouncing Ball
===============

In this assignment you will make an animation that includes a ball or some other shape that appears to bounce.

Program Requirements
--------------------
+ A ball or other shape that appears to move around the screen and bounce off the edges or other objects
+ Other elements besides the ball, for example, other bounding objects rather than the edge of the screen or a background that shows the environment where the ball is bouncing
+ Modify the background, title, headline and footer of your webpage by modifying the html and css files of your webpage

Suggested Steps to get started
------------------------------
1. Watch this video: [Bouncing Ball Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO3Awjn_gyU)   
2. Start a new P5 project
3. Write a program similar to the one shown in the video and then customize your animation by adding additional elements
4. When you are happy with your animation, choose *Share* and copy the *Present* link into google classroom

Extensions
----------
Your animation could have the ball change colors when it bounces (hint: color variables). You could also change the rate at which the ball moves in the y direction to simulate gravity (Another hint: variables for the speed in the x & y directions).
